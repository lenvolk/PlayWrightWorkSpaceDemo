## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Azure Issues**

### **🔐 Authentication Problems**
```powershell
# Check Azure CLI authentication
az account show

# Re-authenticate if needed
az login

# Verify Playwright Workspaces access
az extension add --name playwright
az playwright show --workspace-name <your-workspace>
```

### **🎭 Workspace Configuration Issues**
```powershell
# List available Playwright Workspaces
az playwright list

# Verify resource permissions
az role assignment list --scope "/subscriptions/<sub-id>/resourceGroups/<rg-name>"

# Update environment configuration
.\setup-interactive.ps1 -ReconfigureOnly
```

### **⚡ Test Execution Problems**
```powershell
# Verify Azure configuration
npx playwright test --config=playwright.service.config.ts --list

# Test with single worker first
npx playwright test --config=playwright.service.config.ts --workers=1

# Check service configuration
node -e "console.log(require('./playwright.service.config.ts'))"
```

### **📊 Portal Visibility Issues**
- **Wait Time**: Test results may take 30-60 seconds to appear in Azure Portal
- **Refresh Portal**: Use Ctrl+F5 to refresh the Azure Portal page
- **Check Resource Group**: Ensure you're viewing the correct Playwright Workspace
- **Permissions**: Verify you have "Playwright Service User" role

# Configure tests for different Azure regions
$env:AZURE_PLAYWRIGHT_REGION = "East US"
npm run test:azure

$env:AZURE_PLAYWRIGHT_REGION = "West Europe" 
npm run test:azure
```

### **🎯 Performance Testing Integration**
```powershell
# Combine Playwright with Azure Load Testing

  - `GET /users/{userId}` - Shows parameter substitution areas for enhancement

#### **🎭 What This Proves**
1. **Code Generation Works**: Swagger specs successfully converted to executable Playwright tests
2. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: API behavior validated across all major browsers  
3. **Professional Reporting**: Enterprise-grade HTML test reports with detailed timing
4. **Real-World Testing**: Shows both successful scenarios and improvement opportunities

#### **📊 Expected Output**
```
Running 24 tests using 4 workers
✅ 12 tests passed (GET endpoints working)
❌ 12 tests failed (POST/parameterized endpoints - expected)  
📈 Detailed HTML report available at http://localhost:9323
```

### 🎯 **Demo Value**
- **Conversion Pipeline**: Proves automatic test generation works
- **Multi-Browser Testing**: Validates API across different engines

- **Enhancement Roadmap**: Identifies areas for further development

*The mix of passing and failing tests is actually **perfect for demos** - it shows working core functionality while highlighting realistic improvement areas!*

## 🔧 **Simple Troubleshooting**

### **If Interactive Setup Fails**
```powershell
# Check Azure CLI installation
az version

# Login manually if authentication fails
az login

# Run with verbose output for debugging
.\setup-interactive.ps1 -Verbose

# Skip Azure login if already authenticated
.\setup-interactive.ps1 -SkipAzureLogin
```

### **If Tests Don't Run**
```powershell
# Make sure you're in the demo directory
cd demo

# Run interactive setup to ensure everything is configured
.\setup-interactive.ps1

# Or install dependencies manually if needed
npm install
npx playwright install
```

### **If Azure Resources Aren't Found**
- **Check subscription**: Make sure you selected the correct Azure subscription
- **Check resource group**: Verify resources exist in the selected resource group
- **Check permissions**: Ensure you have access to the Azure resources
- **Manual configuration**: Edit `.env` file directly if auto-detection fails

### **If MCP Servers Don't Start**
```powershell
# Check configuration
.\mcp\manage-mcp.ps1 -Action config

# Start servers manually
npm run mcp:start

# Check server status
npm run mcp:status
```

### **If No Test Report Opens**
- The HTML report should auto-open at `http://localhost:9323`
- If not, manually open: `npx playwright show-report`

### **Understanding Test Results**
- ✅ **Green tests** = Conversion working perfectly
- ❌ **Red tests** = Expected failures showing real-world scenarios
- 📊 **Both are valuable** for demonstrating capabilities and improvement areas

## 🎭 MCP Server Management
